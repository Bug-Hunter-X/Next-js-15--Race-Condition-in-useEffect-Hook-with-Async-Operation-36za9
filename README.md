# Next.js 15: Race Condition in useEffect Hook

This repository demonstrates a potential race condition in a Next.js 15 application.  The issue arises from an asynchronous operation within a `useEffect` hook, which may lead to unpredictable behavior or errors if not handled correctly. 

## Bug Description

A race condition occurs when multiple processes access and manipulate shared resources concurrently, leading to unexpected results. In this case, the `useEffect` hook performs an asynchronous fetch operation. If this operation isn't properly managed, it might interact poorly with other components or events, potentially resulting in errors or inconsistent data. 

## Solution

The solution focuses on ensuring the asynchronous operation is correctly managed using appropriate techniques such as `Promise.all`, data loading states, or by moving the fetch operation to a more appropriate lifecycle method.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the `/about` page.  Observe any inconsistencies or errors in the console. (Note that the error might not occur on every load, depending on timing).
